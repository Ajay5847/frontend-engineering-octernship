# Duplicate Character Remover

The project is a web application that allows users to enter a string and see a representation of the string as a set of cards, with each card representing a character in the string. The cards have a delete icon that allows users to remove all other instances of the same character from the list of cards except the one clicked. If there are no duplicates left in the list of cards, a "check" button is displayed to indicate success. The user can navigate back to the input page using a back button.


## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple and intuitive way for users to see the unique characters in a given string and easily delete duplicates.

## Technologies
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Target Audience
The target audience for this project is anyone who needs to quickly and easily remove duplicates from a string.

## Features
Enter a string on the input page.\
Display a set of cards on the show page, each representing a unique character in the string.\
Cards have a delete icon that removes all other instances of the same character except the clicked one.\
If there are no duplicates left, a "check" button is displayed.\
Users can navigate back to the input page using a back button

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
